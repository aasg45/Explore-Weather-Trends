# Explore-Weather-Trends

The Goal of the project was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where we live.

In this project, I will compare the temperatures of my city (Riyadh) from 1848 to 2013 compared to the global temperature.
firstly I extracted data from database by sql And then export the data in file CSV , Then I did an Excel analysis of the data by creating a graph comparing the temperatures .
